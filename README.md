# Machine learning
1. **Neural red and examples (without libraries)**:
I defined a neural network without using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, etc. I only used NumPy and libraries for visualization. The activation functions used are sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh. I experimented with different combinations of activation functions, the number of hidden layers, and the density of each layer.
2. **Neural network 2x3x2**, **4-layer neural network**:
In these jupyter notebooks I used data points as inputs.
